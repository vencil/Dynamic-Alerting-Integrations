"""test_federation_audit_mtail.py — federation-audit.mtail compile gate (#908)

Codifies a CI compile check for
``helm/federation-gateway/files/federation-audit.mtail`` — the mtail program that
derives ``tenant_federation_requests_total`` (ADR-020 IV-2f) and
``tenant_log_query_requests_total{account_id,project_id,status}`` /
``tenant_log_query_duration_ms`` (ADR-021 #609 PR-4) from the Envoy audit access
log.

Why this gate exists (#908 secondary line): the ``.mtail`` program is COMPILED by
the mtail sidecar at POD START. A syntax / type regression in the program
therefore surfaces only at deploy time (the sidecar CrashLoops), NOT in CI —
mtail otherwise has zero CI presence. This pins ``mtail --compile_only`` as a
gate, mirroring the ``vector validate`` codification in
``test_vector_projection_vrl.py`` and the promtool rule-pack gate.

mtail 3.0.8 — the SAME version the audit-sidecar deploys
(``helm/federation-gateway/audit-sidecar/Dockerfile`` ``MTAIL_VERSION`` /
``values.yaml`` ``auditLog.image.tag``) — so the gate compiles against exactly
the runtime compiler.

Gated on ``mtail`` being on PATH (``shutil.which``); CI installs a pinned +
checksum-verified mtail (ci.yml ``python-tests`` job) so the gate is REAL there.
Without that install the behavioural tests SILENTLY SKIP — the same philosophy as
the Vector / Helm installs alongside them.
